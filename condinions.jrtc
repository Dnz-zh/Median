Realize the logic of the sort method, which must sort the data in an array by distance from its median.
Return the sorted array from the minimum distance to the maximum.
If the remoteness is the same in several numbers, then sort them in ascending order.

An example of an incoming array:
13, 8, 15, 5, 17
median - 13

sorted array:
13, 15, 17, 8, 5
